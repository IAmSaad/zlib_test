# Testing zlib for CERN's FASER project 
Evaluation program (Windows only at this time) for testing zlib's capabilities.
Heavily based on https://www.zlib.net/zlib_how.html and zpipe.c, testzlib.c examples from zlib's github repository.

## Info
Compresses an input file using zlib's two distinct compression levels namely `Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` (optimal speed/compression tradeoff) and `Z_BEST_COMPRESSION` (best compression ratio), reports the output compressed file sizes and compression ratios along with the time taken to do both compressions.

## Usage
The /x64/Release/ directory contains the test program "zlib_build_test.exe" in it. 

Run the program from command line like this:

`zlib_build_test.exe -c "file_to_compress_with_extension" "name_of_compressed_output_file_with_extension"`

The `sample.txt` provided in the same folder (/release) can be used to test out this program, in this case to run the program the command will be :

`zlib_build_test.exe -c "sample.txt" "sample.z"` 

Here sample.z is the output file's name. The .z extension is randomly given and can be alphanumeric combination.

## About the Code
`zlib_build_test.cpp`: is the main file that has been modified from the zlib/example/zpipe.c. It contains all the functionality of the example program like command line argument handling, file handling, doing compression at two levels, printing compression statistics and timing etc.

## Building the Code
Download the .zip file, extract and open the *"zlib_build_test.sln"* using *Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition*. Once it is opened, build the project. The built executable zlib_build_test.exe will be in the x64/Release folder
